# Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS)

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the Asset Description Metadata Schema.

The Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) is a vocabulary to describe reusable solutions, such as data models and specifications, reference data and open source software. It was created with the help of a working group of experts. On 1 August 2013, W3C published ADMS as a W3C Working Group note (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/).

Copyright Â© 2016 European Union. This vocabulary is published under the ISA Open Metadata Licence v1.1, https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/licence/isa-open-metadata-licence-v11

The current version of ADMS can be downloaded from https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/asset-description-metadata-schema-adms-revision.

Any problems encountered, or suggestions for new functionalities can be submitted as issues on the ADMS repository on GitHub. A short guideline for submitting issues can be found at https://github.com/SEMICeu/ADMS/wiki.
